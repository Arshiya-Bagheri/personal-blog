        <p>
            Hi, Iâ€™m Arshiya ðŸ‘‹ â€” a curious learner whoâ€™s passionate about programming, technology, and building things from scratch.  
            I created this blog as a space to document my journey in software development, share what I learn along the way, and post about the projects Iâ€™m working on.  
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is simple: to improve as a developer while creating something useful, and maybe inspire or help others who are on the same path.  
            Expect posts about coding, experiments, ideas, and anything that excites me as I grow. ðŸš€
        </p>
